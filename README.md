# CAnD3-Dragons-Den
This is a repository for Tim &amp; Trinity's Dragon's Den project for CAnD3

<strong> Project Info: </strong>

Our project uses publicly-available marijuana arrest data from the city of Los Angeles, USA between the years 2010 and 2019. The data can be found at https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Marijuana-Data/yimz-8uqv

We are interested in assessing racial dispairities in the frequency and severity of arrests/charges. We are interested in answering two main research questions:
1) Did the legalization of cannabis in California (in 2016) narrow racial differences in marijuana-related arrest rates?
2) Are certain races more likely than others to be charged with more serious offenses (ex. simple possession vs. possession w/ intent to distribute)?

<strong> Repository Info: </strong>

Included so far in this package are the final dataset, Stata do-file, and log file for cleaning the dataset. The repository will be updated after running analyses and developing the presentation.
